1. What is responsible for defining the routes of the games resource?

  * The Request Helper code seems to be responsible. The games model interprets what the viewer is asking for and sends that to the appropriate restful route via RequestHelper (which then communicates with the db/server)

2. What are the the responsibilities of server.js?

  * Connecting to the appropriate database and listening on a particular port for user input

3. What are the responsibilities of the gamesRouter?

  * Creates all the CRUD routes for the API

4. What process does the the client (front-end) use to communicate with the server?

  * Through the HTML interface, the client makes a particular request (GET, POST, DELETE etc.) which the server takes in and responds to

5. What optional second argument does the fetch method take? And what is it used for in this application? Hint: See Using Fetch on the MDN docs

  * Without the second argument, fetch defaults to 'GET' when calling on APIs/webpages. The second argument allows the program to make 'POST', 'DELETE' etc.

6. Which of the games API routes does the front-end application consume (i.e. make requests to)?

  * /api/games 

7. What are we using the MongoDB Driver for?

  * To allow Node.js to communicate with a MongoDB
